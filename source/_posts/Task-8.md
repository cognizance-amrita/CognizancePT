<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1rem;">What is a virtual machine?</b>

A virtual machine is nothing but a computer that runs inside a computer. It has access to CPU, memory and even the internet. But it cannot access USB devices or other hardware resources.

VMs are generally used in :

- Server virtualization
- Testing out virus infected software as it is separated from the host machine.



If the virtual machine is stored on a virtual disk, it is often referred to as a disk image. A disk image may contain the files for a virtual machine to boot, or, it can contain any other specific storage needs.

VMs work by the process called as Virtualization.  Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.

Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.

To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.
