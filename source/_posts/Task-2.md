<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 2rem;">Pseudo Code</style></b>

#### Pseudocode is an informal language description that helps programmers to approach a problem and develop algorithms to solve it. It is written in the form of annotations and informative text written in plain English. It does not require any programming language syntax or any other strict constraints and thus it cannot be compiled or interpreted by the computer.

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">How to write a Pseudo-code?</style></b>

* Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly. 
* Start with the statement of a pseudo code which establishes the main goal or the aim.<br>
__Example:__ 
```
This program will allow the user to check the number whether it's even or odd.
```

* The way the if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program, indent the statements likewise, as it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. They also improve the readability to a great extent.<br>
__Example:__
```
if "1"
    print response
        "I am case 1"

if "2"
    print response
        "I am case 2"
```
* Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach to follow what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will be the same as per it, so the naming must be simple and distinct.<br>
* Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for constants and lower case for variables.<br>
* Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.<br>
* Use standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’ the way we use it in programming.<br>
* Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand and comprehend.<br>
* Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It is necessary to be simple to understand even for a layman or client, hence don’t incorporate too many technical terms.<br>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 2rem;">Flowchart</style></b>

#### A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. In programming, it is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. Flowchart has few symbols which can be considered as its basic syntax. Watch the videos in the resources to learn more about flowchart.

## Write Pseudo code and Flowchart for the source codes of the following programs. 


#### In this task, you will write pseudo code and flowchart to approach a problem statement and find solutions to the following 2 problems.
<br>



__<span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1rem;">Problem-1</span>__

#### Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the '%' operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).
__NOTE:__ You can use '%' operator to separate each digit of the given number(like N % 10).
##### Sample Input 1
```
123
```
##### Sample Output 1
```
True
```
<br>

##### Sample Input 2
```
98
```

##### Sample Output 2
```
False
```
<br>

__<span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1rem;">Problem-2</span>__

#### Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. (Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,...)
##### Sample Input 1
```
5
```
##### Sample Output 1
```
5
```
<br>

##### Sample Input 2
```
11
```
##### Sample Output 2
```
89
```

# Task

<span style="color: #ECB390; font-weight: bold;">1. In the repository  'Cognizance' which you created on GitHub for other tasks, create a folder named 'Task-2'</span> <br> 
 
<span style="color: #ECB390; font-weight: bold;">2. Upload the pseudocodes written in .txt files as 'Problem1.txt' & 'Problem2.txt' and the flowcharts as png/jpg image files like 'Problem1.jpg' & 'Problem2.jpg' in the 'Task-2' folder & Submit The GitHub Repo Link Just Like The Task-1 </span>
