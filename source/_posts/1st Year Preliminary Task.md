**<span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1rem;">Question 1</span>**

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Numpy</span>**

**NumPy is a popular Python library used for working with numbers and arrays. Think of it as a tool that helps you do math and handle large sets of numbers easily. It makes it simple to perform calculations on lists of numbers and matrices. NumPy is great for anyone who wants to do data analysis or scientific computing because it speeds up these tasks with its fast and powerful features.**

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">DataSet</span>**

We use a dataset of details about 15 students each having attributes – Height, Weight, Age, Average Grade and Courses. We use the python code given below to create a NumPy array of our dataset.

**Python code to create NumPy array for the task:**

```lua

import numpy as np
# Creating a dataset with 15 students and 5 attributes
data = np.array([
    [170, 65, 19, 85, 5],
    [180, 75, 20, 90, 6],
    [160, 55, 18, 80, 4],
    [175, 70, 21, 88, 7],
    [155, 50, 19, 82, 5],
    [165, 62, 22, 89, 6],
    [178, 80, 23, 91, 7],
    [162, 58, 20, 78, 3],
    [172, 68, 19, 86, 5],
    [169, 66, 20, 84, 4],
    [171, 64, 22, 87, 6],
    [177, 72, 21, 90, 9],
    [174, 76, 24, 88, 8],
    [158, 52, 18, 75, 3],
    [164, 63, 19, 81, 4]
])

# Printing the dataset with student labels
print("Student\tHeight\tWeight\tAge\tAvg Grade\tCourses")
for index, student in enumerate(data):
    print(f"Student {index + 1}\t{student[0]}\t{student[1]}\t{student[2]}\t{student[3]}\t\t{student[4]}")
    
```

<span style="color: #ADD8E6;">_Objective:_</span>
- <span style="color: #FF6363;">Question 1.1 : </span>Find the Average Height of the Students
  
    Explanation: You need to use the mean() function from NumPy to compute the average value of the height column in the dataset.

- <span style="color: #FF6363;">Question 1.2 : </span>Find the Age of the Oldest Student

    Explanation: Use the max() function from NumPy to find the maximum value in the age column and determine the age of the oldest student.

- <span style="color: #FF6363;">Question 1.3 : </span>Find the Index of the Student Who Took the Most Courses

    Explanation: Use the argmax() function from NumPy to locate the index of the maximum value in the number of courses column.

- <span style="color: #FF6363;">Question 1.4 : </span>Find the Number of Students with an Average Grade Above 85

    Explanation: Use a NumPy condition to filter the dataset for students with an average grade above 85, and then use the sum() function to count them.

- <span style="color: #FF6363;">Question 1.5 : </span>Calculate the Ratio of a Student's Age to Their Average Grade for Each Student

1. **Basic input and output:**

In programming, **input** and **output** are fundamental concepts that allow a program to interact with its environment, typically by receiving data from the user (input) and presenting results or information (output).

**A simple example of python code involving both user input and output:**

```lua
# Simple calculator

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

2. **Conditional statements:**

Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to make decisions based on certain conditions. These statements enable your code to execute different blocks of code depending on whether specific conditions are met or not. In this blog post, we'll delve into the basics of conditional statements, starting with the ubiquitous if-else statement and gradually exploring more complex scenarios.

**A simple flowchart demonstrating the working of conditional statement is shown as below:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322f144f-fc4e-4f11-9371-dff3858c70e2)

- 'if statement' is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. It allows us to conditionally execute code based on whether the specified condition is true.
- 'else statement', on the other hand, is an optional companion to the if statement. It specifies what code to execute if the condition in the if statement is not met (i.e. if it is false).

3. **Introduction to 'for' loop:**

A for loop is a control structure in programming that allows you to execute a specific block of code repeatedly. It's especially useful when you want to perform the same task multiple times without duplicating your code. Let's break down the essential components of a for loop:

**Initialization:** You declare and initialize a variable that serves as a counter. This step only happens once at the beginning.

**Condition:** You specify a condition that determines when the loop should stop executing.Increment/Decrement: You define how the counter variable changes after each iteration.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/514421c2-366e-4feb-833f-576d2408adef)

4. **Introduction to 'while' loop:**

A while loop follows a simple sequence of steps:**1\. Evaluation of Test Expression:** The loop begins by evaluating a test expression.Condition Check: If the test expression is true, the code inside the loop's body is executed.

**Re-evaluation:** After executing the code, the test expression is evaluated again.Continuation or Termination: This process continues until the test expression becomes false, at which point the while loop terminates.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf65bd39-7114-433a-ab35-92d112e8e6a6)

While loops can be best illustrated with the practical example of finding the Factorial. Factorial of a number 'n' is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 'n'. To compute this using a while loop, we initialise a factorial variable to 1 and repeatedly multiply it by 'n' while decrementing 'n' until 'n' becomes 0. This ensures that we calculate the factorial correctly.

**5\. Introduction to functions:**

In programming, a **function** is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help organize code, make it reusable, and improve its readability. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever you need it.

**Why to use Functions?**

- **Reusability:** Write a function once, use it many times.
- **Organization:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Modularity:** Functions allow you to organize code into separate sections.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update code. Changes in a function are reflected wherever the function is used.
