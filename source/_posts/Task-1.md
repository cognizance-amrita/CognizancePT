<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.4rem;">PART 2:</span></b>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">Documentation skills</style></b>

<br>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">What is Markdown?</style></b>

#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

<br>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">Why use Markdown?</style></b>

#### A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs. Markup languages are designed to be readable by humans. This makes it easy for you to understand what data markup languages are representing. Documentation of a project or any work is necessary for other people who are interested in your work to know more about it. Especially for projects/programs that help others' code, documentation is a must for effective usage and benefit of the project. Markdown makes this requirement satisfied with its expressive formats.
<br>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">Variants</style></b>

#### There are several variants of markup, most popular standard being CommonMark. GitHub had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009, adding support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting block content inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc. In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark.
<br>

<b><span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1.2rem;">How to write Markdown?</style></b>

#### Following are the few important markdown syntax. Visit the official documentations of CommonMark or GFM or other markdown variants to know more about the syntax of the language, Feel Free To Use The Official Cheat Sheet of Markdown From The resources section.
