**<span style="color: #FF6363; font-size: 1rem;">Question 1</span>**

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">RDBMS</span>**

**MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and organizing data. Known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, MySQL is widely used in web applications, data warehousing, and logging applications making it a top choice for developers and organizations to handle large volumes of data efficiently**

<span style="color: #ADD8E6;">_Preparatory Step:_</span>
- Download MySql from [<span style="color: #55AAFF;">MySql.org</span>](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- Use the *MySQL Command Line Client* to do the tasks and not *MySQL WorkBench*

<span style="color: #ADD8E6;">_Story Line:_</span>

Skyways, a regional airline, was facing significant challenges in managing its operations. The airline was experiencing frequent delays, cancellations, and a decline in customer satisfaction. These issues were primarily attributed to manual processes and outdated systems that were unable to keep up with the growing complexity and demands of the airline's operations.

Recognizing the urgent need for improvement, the airline's management decided to develop a modern Flight Management System. The goal was to automate key processes, improve decision-making, enhance customer service, and seamlessly integrate with existing systems.

**Skyways' primary goal:** To develop a comprehensive Flight Management System using **Tkinter** as the GUI and **MySQL** as the backend database.

<span style="color: #ADD8E6;">_Objective:_</span>

- Create a Table with an available flight list (Flight Number, Start, Destination, Price, etc.)
  
- Create an empty table for the user's booked flight list.
  
- Use Tkinter and MySQL Python connector, On booking a ticket check the available options and choose the flight
  
- Using Tkinter to Display the user-booked flight ticket
  
- Using Tkinter to Cancel user-booked flight ticket

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Story Driven - Decrypting the Cipher Code</span>**

In the bustling city of Technopolis, where the world's most brilliant minds gather, the prestigious Cognizance Club is renowned for its cutting-edge innovations and breakthrough technologies. Recently, the club developed a revolutionary machine-learning algorithm that could predict cyber threats with unprecedented accuracy. However, just days before the algorithm's official presentation, it was stolen from the club's secure servers.

The club's administration is in a state of panic. The algorithm, if fallen into the wrong hands, could be used for malicious purposes. The city's cybercrime unit is already on the case, but they need the help of the brightest minds to solve this mystery swiftly. The thief left a mp3 file, stating that if cracked, it would lead to the recovery of the stolen algorithm.

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Arrays:</span>**
 
- An array is a collection of data storage locations, each with the same data type and name.
  
- An array can be visualized as a row in a table, whose each successive block can be thought of as memory bytes containing one element.
  
- Each storage location in an array is called an array element. 


**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Arrays are of two types:</span>**

- Single or One-dimensional arrays. 

- Multidimensional eg. two-dimensional arrays.
  
 
**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Single Dimensional Array</span>**

- A single-dimensional array has only a single subscript. 

- A subscript is a number in brackets that follows an array name. 

- This number can identify the number of individual elements in the array. 

- Individual array elements are stored in sequential memory locations. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70a2b23d-545f-45f7-b4d8-348a002aa0b5)


- In this example “age” is the array of type “int” having 5 elements.
   
- Each element of the array is identified by the subscript number starting from 0 to 4.
   
- If the address of the  age[0] is 2120d and the size of int be 2 bytes,  

 
Then the address of the next elements shall be 
```bash
             age[1] is 2122d              
             age[2] is 2124d             
             age[3] is 2126d             
             age[4] is 2128d 
```

Accessing array elements 

- An element is accessed by indexing the array name. 

- This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. 

- **For example:** ```double salary = balance[9];``` The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to the salary variable. 

**Example 1:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f357c8e-ec6d-4f09-8820-63e538960fd5)

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result: 

```bash
Element[0] = 100. 
Element[1] = 101. 
Element[2] = 102. 
Element[3] = 103. 
Element[4] = 104. 
Element[5] = 105. 
Element[6] = 106. 
Element[7] = 107. 
Element[8] = 108. 
Element[9] = 109. 
```

 
**Example 2: Calculate Average**

```bash
// Program to find the average of n numbers using arrays 

#include <stdio.h> int main() {      

int marks[10], i, n, sum = 0, average; 
printf("Enter number of elements: ");    
scanf("%d", &n); 
 
 for(i=0; i<n; ++i) 
 {
  printf("Enter number%d: ",i+1);
  scanf("%d", &marks[i]); 
 
  // adding integers entered by the user to the sum variable
 
  sum += marks[i]; 
 } 
 
average = sum/n;    
printf("Average = %d", average); 
return 0; 

} 
```
 
**Output**

```bash
Enter n: 5 
Enter number1: 45 
Enter number2: 35 
Enter number3: 38 
Enter number4: 31 
Enter number5: 49 
Average = 39 
```



**Example 3: Find the Largest/Smallest of the Elements of an Array**


- We set the largest to the value of the first element of the array. 

- Then we compare this value to each of the other elements in the array. 

- If one is larger, we replace the value in largest with the value and continue to check the rest of the array.

LINK: <http://www.hackerrank.com/preliminary-task-2nd-year>

_<span style="color: #ADD8E6">Scoring Criteria:</span>_

Each challenge has a pre-determined score. A participant’s score depends on how many test cases a participant’s code submission successfully passes. If a participant submits more than one solution per challenge, then the participant’s score will reflect the highest score achieved. In a game challenge, the participant's score will reflect the last code submission. Participants are ranked by score. If two or more participants achieve the same score, then the tie is broken by the total time taken to submit the last solution resulting in a higher score.

**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Data Preprocessing with Iris Dataset</span>** 

**Objective:** The goal of this task is to understand and apply basic data preprocessing techniques using the Iris dataset. This task will help you understand the basics of data preprocessing, including handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and performing exploratory data analysis.

**Data preprocessing:** Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline, where raw data is transformed into a clean and usable format. This process involves several steps.

**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting errors, and removing duplicates. Techniques include imputation, where missing data is filled in, or outlier removal to eliminate anomalies.

**Data Transformation:** Scaling features to ensure they are on the same scale (e.g., normalization or standardization), encoding categorical variables into numerical values (e.g., one-hot encoding), and transforming data to meet the assumptions of a model (e.g., log transformation).

**Data Reduction:** Reducing the dimensionality of the data through techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection, which helps improve model performance and reduce computation time.

**Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable (species of iris).
