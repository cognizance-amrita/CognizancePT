# Part - 2 (Building Websites with HTML & CSS)  
### Create an attractive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a chance to showcase your creativity. The theme is up to you, and it should be user-friendly. 

Here's how to do it:

#### Steps to Create the Landing Page:
##### Step 1: VS Code

1. If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from [<b><span style="color: #FE83C6">VSCode<span></b>](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your project files. You can name it something like "MyProject".
3. Open VS Code.
4. Click on "File" in the top left corner.
5. Select "Open Folder..."
6. Choose the folder you created in Step 2 ("MyProject") and click "Open."
7. In VS Code, right-click on your project folder in the sidebar (on the left).
8. Select "New File."
9. Name the file "index.html" and press Enter. This will be your HTML file.
10. Repeat the process to create two more files: "styles.css" for your CSS and "script.js" for your JavaScript.
11. Open each file by clicking on them in the sidebar.
12. Write your HTML code in "index.html," CSS code in "styles.css," and JavaScript code in "script.js."
13. Live Server Extension (Recommended)	
- In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the left sidebar.
- Search for "Live Server" and install the extension by Ritwick Dey.
- Once installed, you'll see a "Go Live" button at the bottom right of the VS Code window. Click it.
- Your default web browser should open, displaying your HTML file. Any changes you make in your code will automatically refresh the page.
15. Alternative: Without Live Server
- Open your "index.html" file in your web browser directly by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with..." and choosing your browser.
- To see changes, you'll need to manually refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R).

##### Step 2: GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub (github.com) and sign in or create an account if you don't have one.
2. Click the "+" sign in the top right corner and choose "New repository."
3. Give your repository a name (e.g., "Cognizance-Landing-Page").
4. Choose "Public" for the visibility so that others can see your work.
5. Click "Create repository."

<hr>

##### Step 3: Organize Your Repository
1. Inside your repository, click "Create new file" and name it "index.html."
2. Create two more folders: "css" and "js" (if not already created).
3. Inside the "css" folder, create a file named "styles.css."
4. Inside the "js" folder, create a file named "script.js."
5. Paste your code from VS code in the respective files

<hr>

##### Step 4: README Documentation
1. In the root of your repository, create a file named "README.md."
2. Describe your landing page project:
   - Mention your chosen theme.
   - Explain any special features.
