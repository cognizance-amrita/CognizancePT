**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Arrays:</span>**
 
- An array is a collection of data storage locations, each with the same data type and name.
  
- An array can be visualized as a row in a table, whose each successive block can be thought of as memory bytes containing one element.
  
- Each storage location in an array is called an array element. 


**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Arrays are of two types:</span>**

- Single or One-dimensional arrays. 

- Multidimensional eg. two-dimensional arrays.
  
 
**<span style="color: #ADD8E6; font-size: 1rem;">Single Dimensional Array</span>**

- A single-dimensional array has only a single subscript. 

- A subscript is a number in brackets that follows an array name. 

- This number can identify the number of individual elements in the array. 

- Individual array elements are stored in sequential memory locations. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70a2b23d-545f-45f7-b4d8-348a002aa0b5)


- In this example “age” is the array of type “int” having 5 elements.
   
- Each element of the array is identified by the subscript number starting from 0 to 4.
   
- If the address of the  age[0] is 2120d and the size of int be 2 bytes,  

 
Then the address of the next elements shall be 
```bash
             age[1] is 2122d              
             age[2] is 2124d             
             age[3] is 2126d             
             age[4] is 2128d 
```

Accessing array elements 

- An element is accessed by indexing the array name. 

- This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. 

- **For example:** ```double salary = balance[9];``` The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to the salary variable. 

**Example 1:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f357c8e-ec6d-4f09-8820-63e538960fd5)

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result: 

```bash
Element[0] = 100. 
Element[1] = 101. 
Element[2] = 102. 
Element[3] = 103. 
Element[4] = 104. 
Element[5] = 105. 
Element[6] = 106. 
Element[7] = 107. 
Element[8] = 108. 
Element[9] = 109. 
```

 
**Example 2: Calculate Average**

```bash
// Program to find the average of n numbers using arrays 

#include <stdio.h> int main() {      

int marks[10], i, n, sum = 0, average; 
printf("Enter number of elements: ");    
scanf("%d", &n); 
 
 for(i=0; i<n; ++i) 
 {
  printf("Enter number%d: ",i+1);
  scanf("%d", &marks[i]); 
 
  // adding integers entered by the user to the sum variable
 
  sum += marks[i]; 
 } 
 
average = sum/n;    
printf("Average = %d", average); 
return 0; 

} 
```
 
**Output**

```bash
Enter n: 5 
Enter number1: 45 
Enter number2: 35 
Enter number3: 38 
Enter number4: 31 
Enter number5: 49 
Average = 39 
```



**Example 3: Find the Largest/Smallest of the Elements of an Array**


- We set the largest to the value of the first element of the array. 

- Then we compare this value to each of the other elements in the array. 

- If one is larger, we replace the value in largest with the value and continue to check the rest of the array.
