## What is HTML?
#### HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to structure a web page and its contents. It tells the browser how to display the content with the help of tags.

<br>

#### The basic structure of an HTML document is as follows.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Page Title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Here goes your main content!
    </body>
</html>
```

<br>

## What is CSS?
#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style a web page. It describes how to display HTML elements on a web page. It is responsible for creating more visually engaging web pages and applications.

#### An external CSS file can be linked to an HTML page with <link> element.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
```

<br>

## What is Js?

#### Js(Javascript) is used to add interactivity to a web page. It is used to add dynamic functionality to a web page it's text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.

```js
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
}
```
```html
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
<p id="demo"></p>
