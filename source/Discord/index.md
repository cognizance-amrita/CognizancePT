> Discord is a voice, video, and text chat app that's used by many peeps to talk and hang out with their communities and friends. It's a home for communities of any size, but it's most widely used by small and active groups of people who talk regularly. The vast majority of servers are private, invite-only spaces for groups of friends and communities to stay in touch and spend time together. There are also larger, more open communities, generally centered around specific topics such as popular games like Minecraft and Fortnite. Users have control over whom they interact with and what their experience on Discord is.

Servers are the spaces on Discord. They are made by specific communities and friend groups. The vast majority of servers are small and invitation-only. Some larger servers are public. Any user can start a new server for free and invite their friends to it.

**<span style="color: #B958A5">Channel</span>**
<b><div style="background:#212326; margin: 1rem 0; -webkit-border-radius: 4px; padding:0 1rem; ">
Discord servers are organized into text and voice channels, which are usually dedicated to specific topics and can have different rules.

* In text channels, users can post messages, upload files, and share images for others to see at any time
* In voice channels, users can connect through a voice or video call in real time, and can share their screen with their friends - we call this Go Live.

**<span style="color: #B958A5">DMs and GDMs</span>**
<b><div style="background:#212326; margin: 1rem 0; -webkit-border-radius: 4px; padding:0 1rem; ">
Users can send private messages to other users as a direct message (DM), as well as start a voice or video call. Most DMs are one-on-one conversations, but users have the option to invite up to nine others to the conversation to create a private group DM (GDM), with a maximum size of ten people. Group DMs are not public and require an invite from someone in the group to join.

**<span style="color: #B958A5">Nitro</span>**
<b><div style="background:#212326; margin: 1rem 0; -webkit-border-radius: 4px; padding:0 1rem; ">
Nitro is Discord’s premium subscription service. Nitro offers special perks for subscribers, such as the option to customize your Discord Tag, the ability to use custom emotes in every server, a higher file upload cap, and discounted Server Boosts.

**<span style="color: #B958A5">Server Boosts</span>**
<b><div style="background:#212326; margin: 1rem 0; -webkit-border-radius: 4px; padding:0 1rem; ">
If your teen is a big fan of a community, they might want to boost the community’s server (or their own). Like Nitro, Server Boosts give servers special perks like more custom emotes, better video and voice quality, and the ability to set a custom invite link. Server Boosts can be bought with Nitro or purchased separately.

**<span style="color: #B958A5">Student Hubs</span>**
<b><div style="background:#212326; margin: 1rem 0; -webkit-border-radius: 4px; padding:0 1rem; ">
Discord Hubs for Students allow students to verify their Discord account with their official student email, and unlock access to an exclusive hub for students at their school. Within the hub, they can connect with other verified students, discover servers for study groups or classes, and share their own servers for fellow students to join. Hubs are not affiliated with or managed by a school or school staff. Servers in a Hub are student-run but may include non-students.
